  {
    question: 'How do you keep score in a basketball game?',
    answer:
      'Basketball uses three scoring values: free throw (+1 point), field goal (+2 points), and three-pointer (+3 points). Tap the corresponding button each time a team scores. The scoreboard automatically tracks the total. To correct a mistake, use the minus button next to the score.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between +1, +2 and +3 in basketball?',
    answer:
      '+1 is for free throws awarded after a foul. +2 is for a regular field goal scored inside the three-point arc. +3 is for shots made from beyond the three-point line. Having separate buttons for each value lets you score faster and reduces errors compared to a simple counter.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this scoreboard for a real basketball game?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The scoreboard is designed for real games: pickup basketball, streetball, high school matches, local league games, and practice scrimmages. It saves the score in your browser so you can reload the page without losing the game state.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I keep score for street basketball or pickup games?',
    answer:
      'Street basketball usually plays to a target score (like 21 or 16) with 1s and 2s (or just 1s). This scoreboard works for any format. Use +1 for regular buckets, +2 for shots behind the arc. Set your own win condition and use the minus button if you make a mistake.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it work offline on mobile?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Once the page loads, the scoreboard works completely offline. Perfect for outdoor courts, gyms without WiFi, or anywhere with a poor signal. You can also go fullscreen and the screen will stay awake so it does not lock during the game.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I keep track of team fouls and the bonus?',
    answer:
      'This scoreboard focuses on the scoreboard itself. For team fouls, you can use the team name fields to manually track fouls (e.g., rename "HOME" to "HOME 3F"). We recommend pairing this tool with a separate foul tracker for official games.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this basketball scorekeeper on my phone?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The interface is designed for mobile first. The +1, +2 and +3 buttons are large and easy to tap with your thumb. Fullscreen mode hides the browser chrome so the scoreboard takes the entire screen, and the screen wake lock prevents your phone from turning off.',

A <strong>three-point field goal</strong> is worth 3 points for shots taken from beyond the arc, marked by the three-point line. Most professional and college games use all three values.
