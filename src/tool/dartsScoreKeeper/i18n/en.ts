    question: 'How does darts scoring work in 501 and 301?',
    answer: 'Players start with a fixed score of 501 or 301 points. Each player takes turns throwing three darts, and the total value of those throws is subtracted from their score. The objective is to reach exactly zero points. If the Double Out rule is enabled, the final winning dart must land on a double segment or the inner bullseye.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a bust in darts and when does it happen?',
    answer: 'A bust occurs when a player scores more points than their remaining total, or reduces their score to exactly one point when the Double Out rule is active. When a player busts, their turn ends immediately, and their score is reset to the total they had at the beginning of that turn.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you calculate a darts average?',
    answer: 'A darts average is calculated by taking the total number of points scored, dividing it by the total number of darts thrown, and multiplying the result by three. This represents the average score a player achieves per standard three-dart turn.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a checkout in darts?',
    answer: 'A checkout is the specific combination of throws needed to reduce the remaining score to zero and win the leg. Professional scorekeepers display checkout suggestions for scores of 170 and below, guiding players on which singles, doubles, or triples to target.',
