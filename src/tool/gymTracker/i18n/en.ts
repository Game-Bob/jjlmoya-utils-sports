    question: 'What is the purpose of workout tracking?',
    answer:
      'It serves to apply progressive overload scientifically. By knowing exactly how much you lifted in the previous session, you can try to beat that mark, guaranteeing muscle growth and long-term strength gains.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What data should I record?',
    answer:
      'The most important thing is the maximum weight (top set) you achieved with good form for a set number of repetitions. Our tool focuses on recording the weight per session to generate your progress chart.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How are the charts interpreted?',
    answer:
      'An upward line indicates you are progressing. A flat line (plateau) suggests you need to adjust your volume, intensity, or recovery. A persistent downward line may be a sign of overtraining.'
