    question: 'How does ping pong scoring work?',
    answer:
      'A standard ping pong game is played to 11 points. You must win by 2 points. If the score reaches 10-10, play continues until one player leads by 2. The server changes every 2 points. Matches are usually best of 5 or 7 games. This scorekeeper tracks all of this automatically.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I use this scorekeeper?',
    answer:
      'Tap the + button under each player to add a point. The game score updates automatically. When a player reaches 11 with a 2 point lead, the game ends and a new game starts. The games won counter tracks how many games each player has won. Tap Finish Match when the match is over.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the server indicator work?',
