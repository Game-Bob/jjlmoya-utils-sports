    question: 'How are points scored in a rugby union match?',
    answer: 'A try is worth 5 points and is awarded when a player touches the ball down in the opponents in goal area. A conversion kick after a try is worth 2 points. Penalty kicks and drop goals are each worth 3 points.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens when a player receives a yellow card in rugby?',
    answer: 'A yellow card results in a sin bin suspension. The player must leave the field for 10 minutes of active match time. Their team plays with one fewer player during this period. The sin bin timer only counts down while the match clock is running.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is a rugby union match?',
    answer: 'A standard rugby union match consists of two 40 minute halves with a 10 minute halftime break. The match clock is stopped during injuries and serious incidents. Extra time may be added for stoppages.',
