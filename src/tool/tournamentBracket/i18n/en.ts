const faqData = [
  { question: 'How does single elimination work?', answer: 'It is a competition system where the participant who loses a match is automatically eliminated from the tournament. Winners advance to the next round (round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals) until only two remain for the grand final.' },
  { question: 'What happens if I have an odd number of players?', answer: 'Our tool automatically handles "BYEs". Some players will advance directly to the second round without playing in the first so the bracket always ends in powers of two (2, 4, 8, 16...).' },
  { question: 'Can I save and share the tournament bracket?', answer: 'Yes, you can share the bracket through a unique instantly generated link. As a registration-free tool, data is kept in your browser while the tab is open.' },
  { question: 'Does it work for eSports tournaments like FIFA or LoL?', answer: 'Absolutely. It is designed to be fast and visual, ideal for managing quick console, PC game or even board and card game tournaments.' },
  { question: 'Is creating tournaments free?', answer: 'Yes, completely free and without restrictions. No premium plans, participant limits, watermarks or intrusive ads. Everything works offline in your browser.' },
  { question: 'Is my data deleted if I close the browser?', answer: 'No. We use LocalStorage to automatically save all your tournaments on your device. You can close the tab, shut down the computer and come back days later: your tournament will still be there. The full history is also persistent.' },
  { question: 'How does the "Next Match" button work?', answer: 'The system automatically detects the next ready matchup (both participants confirmed) but without a result yet. Pressing "Next Match" jumps the view directly to that match.' },
